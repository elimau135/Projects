Coding challenges:

Basic:

  BST
  
  print out number from 1 -> n
    multiple of three: Fizz
    multiple of five: Buzz
    multiple of 3 and 5: Fizz Buzz

  Hello World in different ways

  write function that reverses a given word

  fibonacci sequence -> type in n and print out the n in fibonacci sequence

  prime number tester

  

Intermediate:

  check function to see if BST is balanced

  write function to reverse a word but with the punctuation intact

  find length of shortest transformation sequence (2 words are given and a dictionary's wordlist)

  write a nth number of a fibonacci sequence

  function that prints out all prime numbers in a given string

  visualization of a BST


HARD

  function that inserts a list of numbers into a BST that runs at O(n log n) time

  function that reverses a word with punctuation in O(n) time

  function that checks if n is a prime and a function that prints out all prime numbers as effecient as possible


Code challenges for web development:

  create a web page for your favourite band

  recreate a magazine layout using semantic HTML and CSS Flexbox

  create a static portfolio site



FINANCIAL DATA ANALYSIS

  BASIC

    given the daily values of a stock, write a program that will find how you can gain the most with a single buy sell trade

  INTERMEDIATE

    Given the daily of a stock over several days n, write a program that will find how you can gain the most with a combination of buy sell trades

  HARD

    complete both the basic and intermediate algorithms in the most efficient way possible
